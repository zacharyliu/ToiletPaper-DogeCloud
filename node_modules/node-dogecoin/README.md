# A Node.JS DogeCoin Client!

![DogeCoin](http://static.tumblr.com/ppdj5y9/Ae9mxmxtp/300coin.png)

node-dogecoin is a Dogecoin client for Node.JS. It is a fork of the excellent http://github.com/Weltschmerz/Kapitalize.git intended for use with Dogecoin. It's currently very nearly identical to Kaptialize, which can be used for Dogecoin too. The purpose of this repository is primarily:

* Provide a one-stop resource for the Node.JS developer to get started with Dogecoin integration.
* Prevent would-be Dogecoin web developers worrying whether the Bitcoin client will work out of the box.
* Promote Node.JS development of Dogecoin web apps.
* Identify and address any incompatibilities with the Dogecoin and Bitcoin APIs that exist now and/or in the future.

## Dependencies

You'll need a running instance of [dogecoind](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin) to connect with. If you're running Debian/Ubuntu, this worked for me: http://www.dogeco.in/wiki/index.php/Dogecoind

Then, install the node-dogecoin NPM package.

`npm install node-dogecoin`

## Example

```js
var dogecoin = require('node-dogecoin')()

dogecoin.auth('myusername', 'mypassword')

dogecoin.getDifficulty(function() {
    console.log(arguments);
})

```

## Chaining

Pretty much everything is chainable.

```js
var dogecoin = require('dogecoin')()

dogecoin
.auth('MyUserName', 'mypassword')
.getNewAddress()
.getBalance()
```

## Methods

TODO: Verify and test with Dogecoin.

The [Bitcoin API](https://github.com/Weltschmerz/Kapitalize#commands) is supported as direct methods. Use either camelcase or lowercase.

```js
dogecoin.getNewAddress(function(err, address) {
    this.validateaddress(address, function(err, info) {

    })
})
```
### .exec(command [string], ...arguments..., callback [function])

Executes the given command with optional arguments. Function `callback` defaults to `console.log`.
All of the API commands are supported in lowercase or camelcase. Or uppercase. Anycase!

```js
dogecoin.exec('getNewAddress')

dogecoin.exec('getbalance', function(err, balance) {

})
```

### .set(key [string, object], value [optional])

Accepts either key & value strings or an Object containing settings, returns `this` for chainability.

```js
dogecoin.set('host', '127.0.0.1')
```

### .get(key [string])

Returns the specified option's value

```js
dogecoin.get('user')
```

### .auth(user [string], pass [string])

Generates authorization header, returns `this` for chainability

## Commands

TODO: Verify and test these with Dogecoin.

All [Bitcoin API](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list) commands are supported, in lowercase or camelcase form.
